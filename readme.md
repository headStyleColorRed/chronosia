## Start the Postgres DB
Let's start with the postres container that will save all data on the postgres_data volume

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to check if the database is up and running do a `docker ps` and then display the container's logs by a `docker logs 3290f9616b1b`
```sh
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES

$ docker logs 3290f9616b1b

```

## Set the Diesel schema
First thing, lets create an .env with your postgress data
```sh
echo DATABASE_URL=postgres://root:1234@localhost/chronos > .env
```

Once this is done we can create the migrations running
```sh
diesel migration run
```

## Check DB
If you want to connect to the db you can run this command to join the docker
command line and then enter the psql cli as root with the password provided on the docker-compose

```sh
docker exec -it postgres_db bash
psql -h postgres_db -d chronos -U root ;
```
Once you are inside, you can run the `\l` command and you'll be shown a list of databases
```
chronos=# \l
                             List of databases
   Name    | Owner | Encoding |  Collate   |   Ctype    | Access privileges 
-----------+-------+----------+------------+------------+-------------------
 chronos   | root  | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 postgres  | root  | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | 
 template0 | root  | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/root          +
           |       |          |            |            | root=CTc/root
 template1 | root  | UTF8     | en_US.utf8 | en_US.utf8 | =c/root          +
           |       |          |            |            | root=CTc/root
(4 rows)
```
The table we created is the chronos, so we'll connect to that db by running `\c chronos`, which will allow us to list the relations inside that db with another `\d`.
```
chronos=# \d
                   List of relations
 Schema |            Name            |   Type   | Owner 
--------+----------------------------+----------+-------
 public | __diesel_schema_migrations | table    | root
 public | punches                    | table    | root
 public | punches_id_seq             | sequence | root
 public | users                      | table    | root
 public | users_id_seq               | sequence | root
(5 rows)
```
