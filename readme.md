## Start the Postgres DB
Let's start with the postres container that will save all data on the postgres_data volume

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

If you want to check if the database is up and running do a `docker ps` and then display the container's logs by a `docker logs 3290f9616b1b`
```sh
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES

$ docker logs 3290f9616b1b

```

## Set the Diesel schema
First thing, lets create an .env with your postgress data
```sh
echo DATABASE_URL=postgres://root:1234@localhost/chronos > .env
```

Once this is done we can create the migrations running
```sh
diesel migration run
```
